    allows_empty: True
    description: "An optional parameter which lets you limit the visibility of this app.
                       If you for example put in ['Artist'] as the value for this parameter,
                       any user belonging to the shotgun permissions group Artist will not be

      then decide on an app to launch, launch that app, start
      up the engine and finally load the file. Returns True if
      an application was launched, False if not.
