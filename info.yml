    allows_empty: True
    description: "An optional parameter which lets you limit the visibility of this app.
                       If you for example put in ['Artist'] as the value for this parameter,
                       any user belonging to the shotgun permissions group Artist will not be

                     If you don't want it to appear on the ShotGrid Pipeline Toolkit action menu
                     for a platform, just include it in the the deny_platforms list. Valid values
                     are Windows, Mac and Linux."

  hook_launch_publish:
    type: hook
    description: Launch an application and tell it to load a file.
      Typically, this hook would look at the file extension,
      then decide on an app to launch, launch that app, start
      up the engine and finally load the file. Returns True if
      an application was launched, False if not.
